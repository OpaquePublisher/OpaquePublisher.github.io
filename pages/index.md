This publishing platform provides support for digital publications that have sensitive-image content for which audience-selected redaction is valuable. From dissertations and monographs to novels and other long-form genres, the OOPP provides a built-in option to show and hide fully- or partially-redacted images, with all the support of automated tables of contents, footnotes, and a static-site format that makes maintaining and preserving an online publication easier.
